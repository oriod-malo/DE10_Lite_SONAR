# DE10_Lite_SONAR
A DE10 Lite based FPGA SONAR mini-project connecting a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor as well as generating a radar-like interface in VGA.

The SONAR is uses the HC-SR04 ultrasonic module from Arudino, connected to two ArduinoIO ports as well as +5V VCC and GND in the DE10 Lite. It makes use of a pipelined version of my previous 7-segment display controller, displaying the distance in cm (the dotted 7-Seg display is the one indicating meters)

The distance is also displayed in a Verilog-generated VGA interface where each pixel in the X-Axis corresponds to each centimeter of distance.

Below you can find a video as well as the connection and 7-Segment Displays measuring the distance from the Table to the roof (measuring 1m87cm with the dot separating both 1.87).

A more advanced RADAR system measuring in 3d and individuating the exact position in space and rotating periodically 360Â° could be build from this project given that one has more advanced equipment at one's disposal.
